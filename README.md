# Parallell Computing

## Course content
Optimizing algorithms for both single and multi-processors systems as well as accellerators such as GPUs. Choosing numerical algoriths, use of optimized libraries, compiler optimizations and program profiling. How to take advantage of PC-clusters and graphics cards for computationally large tasks which cannot be run on a single processor system will also be covered. The course includes parallel programming asignments.

## Learning outcome
Understanding parallel programing is becoming increasingly more important as PCs and desktops incorporate multicore and multichip multiprocessor technology. Knowledge: The goal of this course is hence: To give the students a good understanding of optimzing serial programs and algorithms within computational science. Skills: Develop the students programming skills for and future multi- and many-core processor systems.
